![Programming / Web Development Resources](https://www.robotlab.com/hs-fs/hubfs/coding.jpg?width=640&name=coding.jpg) <br />
This is a curated list of some resources of different topics that have helped in my learning to code journey. 

Starting this out as a simple ```README.md``` but I’d like to make it more interactive in the future.

### Coding Challenges
1. [Edabit](https://edabit.com/) <br />
Coding Challenges in various programming languages that have different levels of difficulty. I find the challenges to be bite sized that is suitable for my level of competency

2. [Exercism](https://exercism.io/) <br />
One awesome thing about exercism is the team of friendly and encouraging mentors who will guide you as you work on the challenges

### Coding Courses (*FREE!*)
1. [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/
) <br />
Tutorials and exercises that one can do at his/her own pace at home. It's perfect for busy working adults to slowly earn the certifications

2. [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) <br />
There are free and paid sections of the tracks, and the free ones are basic enough for a complete beginner who just want to get a taste of the curriculum

### Coding Courses (*PAID*)
1. [JabJabJavascript](https://jabjabjavascript.com/
) <br />
The creator is someone who was self taught and cares about teaching Javascript the right way, meaning explaining the concepts clearly and plainly for beginners to follow

2. [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/courses) <br />
The most appealing and colourful Javascript course out there (in my opinion) that exudes an element of fun. I took his Beginner Javascript course and think it is very good to deepen one's fundamentals in the language

### Youtube
1. [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=traversy
) <br />
A respectable self taught developer with more than 1 million subscribers, the reason why Brad is so popular (and very rightly so) is because he explain concepts in detail and show many examples that is easy to comprehend

2. [Florin Pop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeU-1X402kT-JlLdAitxSMA) <br />
Loads of Javascript goodness here. Flavio shows how to solve coding challenges and build things with the ubiquitous Javascript   

### Wireframes
1. [Mockflow](https://mockflow.com/
) <br />
The free tier provides plenty of options and templates to draft out the UI designs of your ideas
2. [Amiresponsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/?url=#
) <br />
Easy way to view your website on devices of various resolutions to check for responsiveness

### Stock photos
1. [Pexel](https://www.pexels.com/
) <br />
Beautiful images of all kinds of categories for all kinds of needs

### Online IDEs (Integrated Development Environment)
1. [Repl.it](https://repl.it/~
) <br />
Great way to test code snippets in different languages and store them neatly in folders afterwards

2. [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) <br />
Just discovered this recently while doing some Node exercises from FreeCodeCamp. Glitch allows the developer to build full-stack web apps in the browser that has a sharable link for anyone to access them

### Remarks
- This list is by no means exhaustive, as I only have that much time for the many resources as a working adult. There are many other incredible resources which I may not have come across or dwell deeply in

- Please feel free to add to the list and leave a short description of why they’re your favourites
